## Hardware Interfaces for VR Applications: Evaluation on Prototypes 
This paper evaluates two virtual reality (VR) games that use a head mounted display (HMD), 
but they have differnt user input interactivity. The first half of the paper talks about the
evolution of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), the author discusses previous hardware
interfaces and VR such as the Microsoft Kinect Sensor and the Nintendo Wii. These previous 
hardware interfaces changed the way people played games by using motion detection, they made 
the users feel more imursed in the game, the game was closer to feeling like reality than ever
before. With the development of HMDs we are one step closer to games feeling like reality. 
In this paper they found that the hydra motion controllers provided players with more immersion, 
while the xbox one controller was more familiar. Another interesting finding in this study is
that the participants didn't need to know beforehand how to use the HMD, this shows that they 
are very intuative.
