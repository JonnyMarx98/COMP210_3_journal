## Hardware Interfaces for VR Applications: Evaluation on Prototypes [1]
This paper evaluates two virtual reality (VR) games that use a head mounted display (HMD), but they have differnt user input interactivity. The first half of the paper talks about the evolution of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), the author discusses previous hardware interfaces and VR such as the Microsoft Kinect Sensor and the Nintendo Wii. These previous hardware interfaces changed the way people played games by using motion detection, they made the users feel more imursed in the game, the game was closer to feeling like reality than ever before. With the development of HMDs we are one step closer to games feeling like reality. In this paper they found that the hydra motion controllers provided players with more immersion, while the xbox one controller was more familiar. Another interesting finding in this study is that the participants didn't need to know beforehand how to use the HMD, this shows that they  are very intuative.

## Exploitation of heuristics for virtual environments [2]
The aim of this paper was to "research how a VR Heuristics proposed by Sutcliffe and Gault has been exploited". In the paper the authors conducted an analysis on the exploitation of the heauristics for virtual environments by Sutcliffe and Gault. They found 50 papers that cited Sutcliffe and Gault, however only 10 of these used the heuristics, the majority of them only used Sutcliffe and Gaults's article as a background citation. I found it interesting that the researchers who did use the heuristics tended to adapt them to suit their own needs. The analysis then prompted them to present a patchwork of heuristics aspects, this means that if the systems that are being evaluated are significantly different, then relevent heuristics will be used for each. This may eliminate the need to adapt the heuristics to suit the system being evaluated. The paper also evaluated the validity of the patchwork approach. To do this they conducted a heuristics evaluation on a crisis managment training simulator and found that 10 of the 12 heuristics had problems. I think the patchwork approach presented by this paper has potentional to be a very effective way to evaluate virtual environments.
